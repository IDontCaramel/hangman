# Hangman Game

This is a console-based Hangman game written in Python. It offers both singleplayer and multiplayer modes, along with fun features like adding custom words to the word list and tracking game scores. This was my first real Python project created for school.

## Features

- **Multiplayer Mode**: Challenge your friend to a game of Hangman!
- **Singleplayer Mode**: Guess a word from a predefined list and try to beat the computer.
- **Add Custom Words**: Expand the word list by adding your own words.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of how many times you win or lose when playing against the computer.

## How to Play

1. Choose your game mode (Singleplayer or Multiplayer).
2. In multiplayer, take turns guessing letters. In singleplayer, try to guess the word before your attempts run out.
3. Keep track of your wins and losses to see how well you perform!

## Installation

Simply clone the repository and run the Python file to start the game.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hangman
python hangman.py
```

Enjoy playing Hangman!
